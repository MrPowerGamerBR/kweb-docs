Getting Started

Before you start
----------------

Some familiarity with `Kotlin <https://kotlinlang.org/>`_ is assumed, as is familiarity with `Gradle <https://kotlinlang.org/>`_,
which handles dependency management.  We highly recommend using `IntelliJ IDEA <https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/>`_,
it practically writes the code for you.
