What's the difference between Kweb and Vaadin?
----------------------------------------------

Vaadin comes with it's own set of UI widgets which you have to use, whereas with Kweb you can use your
favorite JavaScript UI framework (`Semantic UI <https://semantic-ui.com/>`_ is supported out of the box).
Also, being designed for Kotlin rather than Java allows Kweb to take full advantage of Kotlin's numerous
benefits, including a much more ergonomic API.
